# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic Snake game is implemented in JavaScript and uses the p5.js library for rendering. Control the snake, collect the red apples to grow, and avoid running into yourself.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement:
   - Up Arrow: Move Up
   - Down Arrow: Move Down
   - Right Arrow: Move Right
   - Left Arrow: Move Left

2. Try to eat the red apples to increase your score.

3. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body.

4. The game does not save your score, so enjoy playing for fun!
